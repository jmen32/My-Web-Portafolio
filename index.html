                <h2>Hello, I'm Jonathan Mendoza</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a Software Engineering student at Thinkful, currenlty residing in Stephens City, VA.
                </p>
                <!-- add class list to align list items left in css -->
                <p>Some aspects I like about Software Engineering are:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Working on team projects where we all share a common end goal</li>
                    <li>Making life more automated through easy-to-use programs</li>
                    <li>Being challenged by the exciting and constantly evolving world of tech</li>
                    <li>Connecting with other developers who share your passion!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <!-- indented the first lines of about me paragraphs thru css -->
                <p class="indent">After my wife and I welcomed our baby girl into the world in November, 2020, I realized my career in the Food and Beverage industry was no longer my best option and made the decision to pursue my original desire to work as a Web Developer. I came across Thinkful at the perfect time, and I look forward to the beginning of my new career.</p>
                <p class="indent">When I am not coding you can find me at Buffalo Wild Wings enjoying extremely spicy wings while rooting for my teams, or spending my time out with my family making memories.</p>
